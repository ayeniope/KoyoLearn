					<p>5 Tips For Living With A Roomate In School</p>
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="content-content">
				<p>
					Gaining admission to a tertiary institution is a great opportunity to
					gain new knowledge, experience, skills, and friends. You might not be
					able to afford to live alone, which means you have to live in the
					hostel or share a room with someone off-campus to split the rent. Your
					roommate could be your friend or a total stranger but they are all
					people you've not lived with before and you don't have any idea about
					their habits or behaviours at home. Don't be scared, living with a
					roommate could be a pleasant experience if you handle it with
					maturity.
				</p>
				<p class="roomate-tips">
					Here are 5 tips to help you enjoy living with a roommate:
				</p>
				<ul class="content-list">
					<li>
						<span class="dot"></span>
						<span class="content-title"> Don't Expect Too Much</span>
						<p>
							Do not have the expectation that your roommate will be your best
							friend and he will be perfect. You will be disappointed and those
							feelings could ruin your relationship from the get-go. Not
							everyone finds a best friend in their roommates and nobody is
							perfect, not even you. What you should do is plan to have a good
							relationship with him or her regardless of his character.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<span class="dot"></span>
						<span class="content-title">Establish Good Communication</span>
						<p>
							Be the first to reach out. Ask for his phone number. Get to know
							more about him and his family. Being in a place where you can't
							greet or talk to the person you live with is horrible so make sure
							the communication between you is great. When misunderstandings
							occur, the foundation of good communication will help you to
							resolve them quickly.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="dot"></span>
						<span class="content-title">Discuss Your Differences</span>
						<p>
							Another man's meat is another man's poison. The person you're
							going to live with comes from a different family and background so
							your lifestyles won't be the same. You need to sit down and
							discuss the things that make you different from each other. Like
							your eating habits, you might like eating pepper and he hates it.
							He might like eating food with lots of onions but you're allergic
							to it. He might even practice a different religion. You need to be
							aware of all these differences to know how to live with him in
							peace and tolerance.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="dot"></span>
						<span class="content-title">Set Boundaries</span>
						<p>
							Boundaries need to be set. You might be a private person who
							doesn't like sharing his belongings. If you need to make rules
							about it to prevent misunderstandings, do so. Set boundaries about
							visitors coming to your house. Also, you should make it known to
							your roommate if you prefer solitude and quiet when you're at
							home. He would know that he has to do things like play loud music
							or invite friends over when you're not around.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="dot"></span>
						<span class="content-title">Love Your Neighbour As Yourself</span>
						<p>
							This is the last tip that sums everything up. Treat your roommate
							the way you would like to be treated. If you want to be respected,
							give him respect. If you want friendship, be friendly. Show
							empathy. Show love. You will get it back. And if you don't, you'll
							know you tried your best so you can be at peace with yourself
						</p>
					</li>
